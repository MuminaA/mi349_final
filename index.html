        <h3>
            Games are my <strong>passion</strong>
        </h3>
        <p>
            Why are games my passion? well because they let me escape reality<br />
            I can sit for hours and hours on end staring at the screen, playing this well developed art<br />
            admiring the process and dedication it took for someone to output what they imagined in their head <br />
            so why are games my passion? well because they let me escape reality<br />
            but not only that but they are a piece of art that one created and should be admired.
